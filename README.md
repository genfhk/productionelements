# Artifacts of Film Production 

This is the repository for our crowd-sourced soon-to-be docs site, which aims to provide a guide to other archivists dealing with large (or small) collections of film elements created during the production process. These elements pose unique challenges to archivists and collection managers, and we hope that through a combined effort, we can present a range of approaches that work for a variety of institutions.

Stay tuned for more content to come following the Association of Moving Image Archvists conference in Novemeber 2019!
