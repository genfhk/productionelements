  * Physical inspection and processing
    * Arrangement / separation
    * Rehousing & storage

    * Prioritization
    * Strategy (misc. sound & picture elements)
  * Access
    * Research access
    * Reproduction and re-use

## Archivist’s Guide to Film & Video Production
  * Typical production workflows
    * Film production (classic 16, low-budget 16, dual system)
    * Film/video hybrid production
    * Analog video production
  * Artifacts of production
    * By generation? E.g. camera/sound roll/tape, outtakes/trims, Work print, masters, A+B roll, etc
    * By format? Film artifacts, sound artifacts, video artifacts
    * Paper production records: production/post production notes, lab records, timing tape, etc.
